# Sales-Analytics
Developed an analytics system to monitor and evaluate sales performance by analyzing customer and business data. Leveraged Excel to process and visualize key metrics, including sales trends, customer purchasing behavior, and revenue growth. Created automated reports and dashboards to identify pattern.

In this project, I used Excel and pivot tables to analyze net sales and track percentage growth from target years, providing deeper insights into business performance across different countries.
